** TODO M5: Timer & utilities




** TODO M6: Data model & JSON




** TODO M7: Styling & UX polish

Risks / Notes

Ensure =question.type= matches factory map; otherwise fallback UI

Keep =legacy MC= support until all JSON converted

Guard timer cleanup on route leave

Backlog / Ideas

Keyboard navigation and a11y focus management

Per-question difficulty & adaptive sequencing

Review mode: list questions with answers/explanations after quiz

Theming (light/dark)

Import JSON at runtime (drag & drop)
